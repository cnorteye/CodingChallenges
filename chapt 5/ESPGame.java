        ASSIGNMENT: write a program that tests your ESP (extraasensory perception). The program should randomly select the name of a color from the following list of words: 
                    red, green, blue, organge, yellow

                    To select a word, the program can generate a random number.

                    next, the program should ask the user to enter the color that the computer has selected. After the user has entered his or her guess. 
                    the program shoudl display the name of the randomly selected color. The program shoudl repeat this 10 times and then display the number of times the user correctly guessed 
                    the selected color
